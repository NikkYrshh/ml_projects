# AlexNet Implemented and Trained from Scratch in Keras: Dogs vs. Cats Kaggle 

This project demonstrates an implementation of the AlexNet architecture from scratch using TensorFlow Keras. The model is applied to the classic [Dogs vs. Cats classification challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) on Kaggle.

## Overview

- **Model:** AlexNet with minor modifications
- **Dataset:** Dogs vs. Cats (25,000 images)
- **Objective:** Binary classification
- **Accuracy:** Achieved around 92% training accuracy, 88% validation accuracy and 88% test accuracy

## Highlights

- The model was implemented from scratch, closely following the original AlexNet architecture.
- Applied data augmentation techniques and fine-tuned hyperparameters.
- Demonstrated strong performance on a limited dataset of 20,000 images.
