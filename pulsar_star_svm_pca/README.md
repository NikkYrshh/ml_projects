## Pulsar Star Prediction

This project, completed as part of my university coursework, applies an SVM classifier combined with PCA for classification on the Pulsar Star Dataset form Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/colearninglounge/predicting-pulsar-starintermediate). 

The project encompasses exploratory data science, data visualization, classification, further analysis, and interpretation of the results. Additionally, it includes a comparison of the results with and without the application of PCA.
